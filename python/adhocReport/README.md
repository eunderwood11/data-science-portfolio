In this project, I worked within a team of four to write code that would create an ad-hoc report. Data is entered by the user, written to a file, and passed through functions to determine the total hours worked over four weeks, how many overtime hours there were, and total amount due to the employee. We appended employee data to a list and then perform operations upon it to condense the program.

During this project, I learned how to...
* avoid multiple "if" statements by using variables for the invoice statements as well as "while" and "if"/"elif"/"else"
* use camelCase, constants, and end-of-line comments for readability
* apply modularity of code for readability and ease of use
* plan out what needs to be done beforehand rather than diving into complex code
* take programs one section at a time
* avoid redundancy

This code can be run in Python by downloading the files "menu file (launch).py", "BillingModule.py", "adhoc_report.py", and "program_4.py", then opening the menu, which will walk the user through.
