    * **[View Project]**(`https://github.com/eunderwood11/data-science-portfolio/cafedatabase/tree/main`)
 
* **Python Machine Learning Project**
   * *Description:* A project where I cleaned, analyzed, and modeled a public student loan dataset in order to gain experience in modeling real-world data and determining whether certain models are applicable to a dataset.
   * **Skills:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, RegEx, Statsmodels
   * **[View Project]**(`https://github.com/eunderwood11/data-science-portfolio/machine learning/tree/main`)
 
* **Python Introductory Project**
   * *Description:* I wrote code that would create an ad-hoc report. Data is entered by the user, written to a file, and passed through functions to determine the total hours worked over four weeks, how many overtime hours there were, and total amount due to the employee.
   * **Skills:** Python
