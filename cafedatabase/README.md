In this group project, we created a relational database model for a small, family-owned café. Our goal was to design a system that captures the core functions of a café, such as managing menu items, tracking customer orders, organizing seating, and handling staff assignments, while keeping the structure simple and easy to understand. Through this process, we learned how to turn a real-world business concept into a structured data model using MySQL Workbench and SQL. This project gave us hands-on experience in building a practical database from the ground up.

Our database is modeled after a local café that serves coffee, tea, and light meals in a relaxed environment. The café is designed for both dine-in and take-out customers, with a focus on quick service. We included examples of multiple locations, each with their own seating layout and staff. Customers place orders at the counter and orders for drinks are prepared by baristas while food is pre-made by the kitchen staff. Employees can have different roles during different shifts. The café tracks menu item availability and employee assignments to maintain smooth daily operations.

We began by identifying key real-world elements in a café: locations, tables, menu items, customers, orders, and employees. From there, we created tables in MySQL Workbench, defined relationships, and ensured that every table had at least one connection. We ensured referential integrity by foreign keys which were not nullable: for example, you cannot enter an order with a menu item that does not exist.
